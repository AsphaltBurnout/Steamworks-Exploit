# Usage
 Pack the Tool as Windows (x64), then compile the Patcher as Release x64 and place it into MyProject2/Binaries/Win64 directory. Make sure you have steam open and you have Dead by Daylight in your library. Now, you can open MyProject2.exe or MyProject2-Win64-Shipping.exe. **Only for debugging purposes!**
