# Usage
 Pack the Tool as Windows (x64), then compile the Patcher as Release x64 and place it into MyProject2/Binaries/Win64 directory. Make sure you have steam open and you have Dead by Daylight in your library. Now, you can open MyProject2.exe or MyProject2-Win64-Shipping.exe. Lobby Ids and Profile Ids are clickable. You can find out party id through Fiddler. Just open the Fiddler and Dead by Daylight, then my tool and press on lobby id. Check Fiddler and you can see the requests like /party/XXX-XXX-XXX-XXX?includeState <- this is all infos of lobby. **Only for debugging purposes!**
